To speed up this code, you can use the dynamic programming approach to solve the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. This involves filling out a matrix where each cell represents the LCS of a prefix of string s and a prefix of string t.

Here is an example of how you could implement this approach in Python:

```
def longest_common_subsequence(s, t):
    m, n = len(s), len(t)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j])
    i, j = m, n
    result = []
    while i > 0 and j > 0:
        if s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]:
            result.append(s[i - 1])
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j - 1] > dp[i - 1][j]:
            j -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
    return ''.join(reversed(result))
```

This implementation has a time complexity of O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t, respectively. This is significantly faster than the brute force approach of generating all possible subsequences of s and checking if each one is a common subsequence of s and t, which has a time complexity of O(2^m * mn).

The matrix that the function builds is called a dynamic programming matrix, and it is used to store the intermediate results of the LCS calculation as the code runs.

The matrix is initialized to have `m + 1` rows and `n + 1` columns, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`, respectively. The extra row and column are used to store base cases for the LCS calculation.

Then, the matrix is filled out row by row, starting from the second row and second column. For each cell in the matrix, the value is determined based on the following rules:

* If the characters at the current positions in s and t are equal, the value is the value of the cell above and to the left (the "diagonal" cell) plus 1.
* If the characters are not equal, the value is the maximum of the value of the cell above and the value of the cell to the left.

Here is an example to illustrate this process, using the strings "AACCTTGG" and "ACACTGTGA" from the prompt:

```
   "" A  A  C  A  C  T  T  G  A
""  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
A   0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
A   0  1  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2
C   0  1  2  2  3  3  3  3  3  3
C   0  1  2  2  3  4  4  4  4  4
T   0  1  2  2  3  4  4  5  5  5
T   0  1  2  2  3  4  4  5  6  6
G   0  1  2  2  3  4  4  5  6  6
G   0  1  2  2  3  4  4  5  6  7
```

To retrieve the LCS from the matrix, we start from the bottom right corner and work our way back towards the top left corner. Whenever we encounter a cell with a value that is equal to the value of the cell above and to the left plus 1, we know that the character at the current position in `s` and `t` was included in the LCS, so we add it to the result and move diagonally to the left and up. Otherwise, we move either left or up (whichever cell has a higher value) until we reach the top left corner of the matrix.

1. Start from the bottom right corner of the matrix (i.e., the cell at position `(m, n)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `t`, respectively).
2. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
3. While the current row and column index are greater than 0:
	1. If the value of the current cell is equal to the value of the cell above and to the left plus 1, it means that the character at the current position in `s` and `t` was included in the LCS, so we append it to the result and move diagonally to the left and up (i.e., decrement both the row and column index by 1).
	2. Otherwise, if the value of the current cell is equal to the value of the cell above, it means that the character at the current position in `t` was not included in the LCS, so we move up (i.e., decrement the row index by 1).
	3. Otherwise, if the value of the current cell is equal to the value of the cell to the left, it means that the character at the current position in `s` was not included in the LCS, so we move left (i.e., decrement the column index by 1).
4. Return the result as a string by joining the reversed list of characters.
