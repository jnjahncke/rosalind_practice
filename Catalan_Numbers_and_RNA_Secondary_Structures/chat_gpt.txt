Here is what ChatGPT had to say about its first script:

This script first reads the given RNA string from the input file, which is in FASTA format. Then it calculates the number of noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges using a recursive approach with memoization.

The script defines a memoize decorator that can be used to memoize a function, i.e. store the results of previous function calls in a cache so that they can be reused later to avoid repeating computations. The memoize decorator is then used to decorate the dp function, which calculates the number of noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges using a recursive approach.

The dp function takes the RNA string as its argument and returns the number of noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges. If the RNA string is empty, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates over the nucleotides in the RNA string, starting from the first nucleotide, and looks for a matching pair of nucleotides. If a matching pair is found, the function splits the RNA string into two parts, one inside the pair and one outside the pair, and recursively calls itself on both parts. It then multiplies the result of the recursive calls and adds them to the sum. This process continues until the entire string has been processed and all possible noncrossing perfect matchings have been counted.

Finally, the script returns the result of the dp function modulo 1,000,000. The output of the script is the total number of noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges, modulo 1,000,000.
