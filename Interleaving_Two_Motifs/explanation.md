The function takes in two DNA strings s and t as input.

It initializes a 2D array dp to store the lengths of the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two strings. The size of the dp array is (m+1) x (n+1), where m and n are the lengths of s and t, respectively.

It fills the dp array using dynamic programming. Specifically, it iterates over each pair of indices (i,j) in dp, starting from (1,1) and ending at (m,n). If s[i-1] and t[j-1] are equal (i.e., the current characters match), then dp[i][j] is set to 1 + dp[i-1][j-1], which is the length of the LCS that includes the current characters. Otherwise, dp[i][j] is set to the maximum length of the LCS that can be obtained by excluding either the current character in s or the current character in t.

It constructs the shortest common supersequence using the dp array. Starting from the bottom-right corner of dp, it iteratively determines whether the LCS includes the current characters of s and t, or whether it excludes one of them. This information is used to construct the shortest common supersequence by appending characters from s and t to the result list scs. The loop continues until it reaches the top-left corner of dp.

It reverses the result list scs and returns the string obtained by joining its elements.

In summary, the shortest_common_supersequence function computes the LCS of s and t using dynamic programming, and then constructs the shortest common supersequence by iteratively appending characters from s and t based on the LCS.
