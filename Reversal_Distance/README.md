# Problem

A reversal of a permutation creates a new permutation by inverting some interval of the permutation; (5,2,3,1,4), (5,3,4,1,2), and (4,1,2,3,5) are all reversals of (5,3,2,1,4). The reversal distance between two permutations π and σ, written drev(π,σ), is the minimum number of reversals required to transform π into σ (this assumes that π and σ have the same length).

**Given**: A collection of at most 5 pairs of permutations, all of which have length 10.

**Return**: The reversal distance between each permutation pair.

## Sample Dataset:

3 10 8 2 5 4 7 1 6 9
5 2 3 1 7 4 10 8 6 9

8 6 7 9 4 1 3 10 2 5
8 2 7 6 9 1 5 3 10 4

3 9 10 4 1 8 6 7 5 2
2 9 8 5 1 7 3 4 6 10

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
