# Problem

Say that you place a number of bets on your favorite sports teams. If their chances of winning are 0.3, 0.8, and 0.6, then you should expect on average to win 0.3 + 0.8 + 0.6 = 1.7 of your bets (of course, you can never win exactly 1.7!)

More generally, if we have a collection of events A1,A2,…,An, then the expected number of events occurring is Pr(A1)+Pr(A2)+⋯+Pr(An) (consult the note following the problem for a precise explanation of this fact). In this problem, we extend the idea of finding an expected number of events to finding the expected number of times that a given string occurs as a substring of a random string.

**Given**: A positive integer n (n≤1,000,000), a DNA string s of even length at most 10, and an array A of length at most 20, containing numbers between 0 and 1.

**Return**: An array B having the same length as A in which B[i] represents the expected number of times that s will appear as a substring of a random DNA string t of length n, where t is formed with GC-content `A[i]` (see “Introduction to Random Strings”).
